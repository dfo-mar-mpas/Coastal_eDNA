# Coastal_eDNA
A repository for data and code for coastal environmental DNA bioinformatics and analyses, and analyses of beach seine catch data. 

The MCRG team has collected coastal eDNA samples from nearshore eelgrass beds in Nova Scotia during 2019, 2023, and 2024 to catalog and monitor fish and other animal diversity. We compare eDNA results with species captured in our 25m Danish bag seine to obtain a detailed understanding of species living in eelgrass beds across space and time.
